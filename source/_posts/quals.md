Qualifying exams are the first major hurdle for me as a first-year math graduate student. Here at UC Santa Barbara, we're required to pass exams in three different areas in two years: to stay in the Ph.D. program, you need to get at least two PhD passes and one Master pass. The exams are offered twice a year, giving us four total opportunities to get them done. I was able to pass all of mine in my first year, and in this post, I'd like to share my experience and some tips on how I prepared.

I chose to tackle Algebra, Analysis, and Topology. The topics for each exam are drawn from the standard undergraduate mathematics curriculum. For that reason, it's highly recommended that you prepare during the summer before starting your Ph.D. program. This allows you to take the exams while the material from your undergraduate courses is still fresh in your mind!

 And the algebra, analysis, and topology exams 

UCSB provides students with a repository of previous exams to help us prepare.
